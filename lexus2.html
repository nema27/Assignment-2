            <p  style="font-size:130%; color:lightgray">Enter the realm of automotive luxury with Lexus (レクサス, Rekusasu), the crown jewel of elegance crafted by the master artisans at Toyota Motor Corporation. Across more than 90 countries and territories worldwide, Lexus reigns supreme as Japan's premier purveyor of premium automobiles, boasting a legacy that transcends borders and captivates hearts.

Nestled amidst the vibrant cityscape of Nagoya, Japan, Lexus weaves a tapestry of sophistication and innovation that knows no equal. From the bustling streets of Brussels, Belgium, to the sprawling plains of Plano, Texas, United States, Lexus commands attention with its global operational centers, each a beacon of excellence in its own right.

Born from a visionary corporate project in 1983, Lexus emerged as a symbol of opulence and refinement with the groundbreaking launch of the Lexus LS in 1989. Since then, Lexus has expanded its repertoire to include sedans, coupés, convertibles, and SUVs, each bearing the hallmark of superior craftsmanship and unparalleled luxury.

While Lexus may have started its journey as a premium division of Toyota, it has since carved its own path, captivating enthusiasts worldwide with its distinctive design language and relentless pursuit of perfection. From the hybrid revolution sparked by the RX crossover in 2005 to the exhilarating performance of the F marque, Lexus continues to redefine the boundaries of automotive excellence.

With manufacturing hubs spanning the Chūbu and Kyūshū regions of Japan, Lexus infuses every vehicle with the spirit of Japanese craftsmanship and precision engineering. Assembling a global mosaic of luxury, Lexus debuted in its homeland in 2005, marking a historic milestone as the first Japanese premium marque to grace its native shores.

From the sun-kissed shores of Southeast Asia to the cobblestone streets of Europe, Lexus casts its spell far and wide, enchanting discerning drivers with its hybrid prowess and timeless elegance. Join us as we embark on a journey of luxury and sophistication with Lexus, where every drive is an experience beyond compare.</p>

    <h1 style="color:lightgray">Japan Domestic Market</h1>
    <p style="color:lightgray">These top-tier cars not only offer unbeatable reliability but also boast low maintenance costs, making them the ultimate choice.</p>
    <blockquote class="blockquote" style="color:lightgray">
      <p  style="color:lightgray">The vibrant world of Japanese Domestic Market (JDM) cars unveils a fascinating narrative of innovation and adaptation. These automotive gems boast an average age of 8.7 years, earning a respectable 9th place among 30 leading economies worldwide. Yet, their allure extends beyond mere statistics. In Japan, where every mile is a story, cars tread a different path, covering just over 9,300 kilometers annually—less than half of the journey undertaken by their American counterparts.

    But it's not just about mileage; it's about a culture deeply rooted in innovation. Japanese car owners, known for their penchant for the cutting-edge, drive the evolution of automotive technology. Within the intricate tapestry of the JDM landscape, vehicles diverge from their international siblings, often showcasing pioneering features long before they reach foreign shores. Take, for instance, the 2003 Honda Inspire, heralding the dawn of Honda's Variable Cylinder Management—a revolution in efficiency and performance. Meanwhile, its counterpart, the 2003 Honda Accord V6 aimed at the North American market, missed out on this groundbreaking feature, haunted by the specter of past failures.

    Delving into the annals of JDM history, we encounter a tale of restraint and liberation. In 1988, a cap of 280 PS and a top speed of 180 km/h were imposed by the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA), steering the course of safety. However, as time unfurled its wings, restrictions loosened, with horsepower limitations cast aside in 2004, while the 180 km/h speed limit remains a steadfast sentinel, guarding the highways of Japan. Through these regulatory shifts and technological leaps, the JDM saga continues, a captivating blend of tradition and transformation.</p>
